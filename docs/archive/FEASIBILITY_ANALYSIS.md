## 1. Market Analysis

### 1.1 The Privacy Payments Gap

**Problem Statement**:
Blockchain's transparent ledger creates a fundamental privacy problem - every transaction amount, balance, and financial activity is publicly visible. This prevents:
- Consumers from making everyday payments without exposing spending patterns
- Businesses from conducting commerce without revealing revenue to competitors
- Institutions from processing payroll without broadcasting employee salaries

**Market Size**:
- **P2P Payments**: Venmo processed $244B in 2024; crypto P2P is <1% penetration
- **Merchant Services**: Global payment gateway market: $87B (2025), growing at 16% CAGR
- **Crypto Payroll**: 72% of companies exploring crypto payroll in 2025 (OneSafe study)
- **Solana Ecosystem**: $15B+ TVL, but <5% has privacy features
